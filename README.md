# Stream Ops for Java
Stream Ops for Java is a fully embeddable data streaming engine and stream processing API for Java.
The data streaming engine and the stream processing API can be used together, or separately.

Stream Ops addresses the same use cases as Kafka, but with some significant design differences which gives you
a higher degree of architectural freedom. You can embed Stream Ops in a mobile app, desktop app, microservice,
web app backend, and possibly also inside serverless functions like AWS Lambda etc. (we are still looking into
how this can be done) and Google App Engine apps.

Stream Ops design differences also supports a wider set of use cases than Kafka does out-of-the-box. We will
describe these differences as the code that provides them is cleaned up and released.
